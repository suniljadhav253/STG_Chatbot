Basic Counts & Aggregations (KPIs / Single Values)

"What is the total number of shipments recorded?"
"Calculate the total actual cost for all shipments."
"How many unique destination locations are there?"
"What's the average shipment weight?" (Assumes a TOTAL_WEIGHT column)
"Total planned cost for shipments in the last quarter using START_TIME."
"Number of shipments currently in 'IN TRANSIT' status." (Assumes a STATUS column)
Distributions & Proportions (Pie/Doughnut/Bar Charts)

"Show me the distribution of shipments by transport mode as a pie chart." (Assumes TRANSPORT_MODE_GID joined to a name)
"What percentage of shipments are hazardous? Display in a doughnut chart." (Assumes IS_HAZARDOUS flag)
"Breakdown of shipment count by service provider name. Show as a bar chart." (Assumes SERVPROV_GID joined to name)
"Distribution of shipment types." (Assumes SHIPMENT_TYPE_GID joined to name)
"How many shipments fall into different cost brackets (e.g., <$500, $500-$1000, >$1000)?" (More complex, might require LLM to generate CASE statements or for you to have pre-defined brackets)
Trends Over Time (Line/Area Charts)

"Show the trend of total shipment count by month using START_TIME."
"Plot the total actual cost of shipments over the last 6 months based on END_TIME as a line chart."
"Monthly trend of average shipment weight using INSERT_DATE."
"Display the cumulative shipment volume over the year using START_TIME as an area chart."
"Trend of min and max TOTAL_ACTUAL_COST by month using START_TIME." (Like your previous successful query)
Comparisons & Rankings (Bar Charts)

"Top 10 destination locations by shipment count." (Should use LOCATION_NAME via join)
"Which 5 service providers have the highest total actual cost?"
"Compare the total weight shipped via different transport modes."
"Bottom 5 origin locations by number of delayed shipments." (Requires joining to a delay table or using a delay flag/status)
"Show me a horizontal bar chart of shipment counts for each SHIPMENT_TYPE_GID."
Relationships & Correlations (Scatter/Bubble Charts)

"Is there a relationship between total weight and total actual cost for shipments? Show as a scatter plot."
"Visualize total volume vs total weight for all shipments."
"Plot TOTAL_ACTUAL_COST against LOADED_DISTANCE as a scatter plot." (Assumes LOADED_DISTANCE column)
"Show shipment count, total cost, and average weight by destination location as a bubble chart." (Bubble charts need X, Y, and bubble size (R) â€“ LLM needs to pick 3 appropriate columns).
Multi-dimensional Analysis (Grouped/Stacked Bars, Complex Tables)

"Top 5 shipment counts by source location name and destination location name in descending order." (Your successful complex query, should result in a table or potentially a complex bar if categories are few)
"Show total actual cost by transport mode and by year (using START_TIME) in a grouped bar chart."
"Stacked bar chart of shipment counts per month (using START_TIME), segmented by SHIPMENT_TYPE_GID."
Follow-up Questions (Testing Memory)

(After "Total shipment count by year"): "What about for the previous year?"
(After "Top 5 destinations by cost"): "Show me the details for the second one on that list."
(After "Shipment distribution by transport mode"): "Which mode had the highest average cost?"
Queries Testing Schema Understanding & Robustness

"Find shipments that started late." (Requires LLM to understand "late" by comparing START_TIME to LATEST_START_TIME or EARLIEST_START_TIME)
"Which shipments have no end time recorded but started more than 30 days ago?"
"Are there any locations that are only origins and never destinations?"
"List shipments with unusual cost to weight ratios." (Very subjective, tests LLM reasoning)
Queries with Explicit (Less Common) Chart Type Requests

"Show me the distribution of TOTAL_ACTUAL_COST in a histogram." (Analyzer would need to create bins)
"Can I see the TOTAL_WEIGHT for different SERVPROV_GIDs using a polar area chart?"
"What's the radar chart for average cost, average weight, and average loaded distance for the top 3 TRANSPORT_MODE_GIDs?" (Complex, requires multiple aggregations and then structuring for radar)
"Give me a KPI tile for the total number of unique SHIPMENT_XID."
"Show a treemap of total shipment count by SOURCE_LOCATION_GID." (If treemap plugin is working)
Tips for Testing:

Start Simple: Begin with basic counts and aggregations.
Vary Phrasing: Ask for the same information in different ways.
Introduce Ambiguity: See how the LLM handles less specific requests.
Check Console Logs: Always monitor the Flask console for:
Requested Chart Type from intent_detection_node.
Retrieved schema parts from schema_retriever_node (are the right columns with good descriptions being fetched?).
Generated SQL from sql_generator_node.
Any errors from sql_executor_node.
The chosen chart type and analysis_summary from analyzer_visualizer_node.
Iterate on database_schema.csv: If the LLM struggles with specific columns or concepts, the first place to improve is usually the descriptions in your CSV, followed by re-indexing.
